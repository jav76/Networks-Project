### Team members:
Joshua Newman, Wilson Woods, Jaret Varn

### Summary
Development of a CLI based chat application using python intended to apply information learned from our computer networks class. The goal is to implement network communication through sockets in python using TCP, UDP, and FTP, and be able to encrypt this information using public-private key exchanges. The goal application is to send and receive chat messages between Raspberry Pi development boards, although practically the code should run on any networked device.
